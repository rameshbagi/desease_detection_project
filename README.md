# desease_detection_project

his project is a web-based intelligent chatbot system that assists users in identifying potential diseases based on symptoms they describe in natural language. It uses AIML to simulate conversations and respond with basic medical advice or recommendations. The system is built using Flask (Python web framework) and can be optionally extended with a Machine Learning (ML) predictor for more dynamic disease detection.
